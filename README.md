# Person list

In this project we write 4 students(persons) in an array as an object and then show them by .map() method in JS and also show it in body in HTML. Also we use .pop() method to delete one object of listArray and .push() method to add 5th or more students. For editing items in any of objects in array, we use .findIndex() method to find index of object that we want to edit and then detemine which item we need to edit in defined object.

# task manager

In this project we put a form with 2 inputs( title of tasks and description of them ) and design it by tailwind. we get value from inputs with their id by querySelector() and with addEventListener() it does something with forexample click on buttons. Next step we put showListButton,when we click on it, it opens bottomDrawer and when we click on closeButton, the bottomDrawer will be close. We describe already an array for pushing new tasks to it and then show it in bottomDrawer.

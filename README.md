# task manager

In this project we put a form with 2 inputs( title of tasks and description of them ) and design it by tailwind. we get value from inputs with their id by .querySelector() and with .addEventListener() it does something with forexample click on buttons. Next step we put showListButton,when we click on it, it opens bottomDrawer and when we click on closeButton, the bottomDrawer will be close.(We can add or remove classes to close and open this drawer).And describe already an array for pushing new tasks to it and then show it in bottomDrawer. In bottomDrawer we show tasks in <li> with 2 child <h2> and <p> with .createElement() and give classes with .className() in typescript. Then add value in them with .innerText method.
